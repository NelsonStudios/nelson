                     <p class="float-left">When it comes to drilling shallow depth shot holes for seismic exploration, productivity is measured by holes drilled per day. Often these holes are 20-30 feet in depth, spread out across varying conditions that could be flat, hilly, soft or hard ground, farm fields, or land covered in brush or trees, or rocks. Fecon manufactures the EX300S which is configured to have what the crew needs where it is needed with as few steps as possible to maximize drill time.</p>
